      <h3>Science Club :</h3>
      <p>Science zone, igniting science in young mind--is a science club of Vidhya jyothi high school, Bangalore. Science, science & science ……its everywhere….and this is mainly because of some enlightened studies enrolled in it. Science can be classified as many types…..symbolically one can be for knowledge, for experiments, for experience and some for destruction. Science encovers the mind and heart of everyone nowadays because of its influence it made it year by year…….the main thing which bothers me is about the job crisis. Employment is one of the major issues of our country all the time but now people think science can make some difference in that. Ex: parents want their kid to join in science courses even the kid is not at all interested in any circuit matters.</p>
